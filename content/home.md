OpsRamp and COM integration has following advantage

* Multi-vendor view of basic hardware metrics of HPE servers and non-HPE servers in OpsRamp dashboard.
* Multi-vendor view of OS and workload level metrics of HPE servers and non-HPE servers in OpsRamp dashboard.
* OpsRamp will aggregate the metrics ingested from COM and metrics ingested from 3rd party servers and show an aggregate view in OpsRamp dashboard.
